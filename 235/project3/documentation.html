        <h2>About Bottle Knights</h2>
        <p>Bottle Knights will be a rougelike-incremental game, in which the player
            interacts with DOM elements to generate bottle caps, which can be refined
            to upgrade their hero (gear, armor, etc).
             In a separate PIXI window, the hero can be seen fighting enemies, 
            which generates more bottlecaps for the player. When the player deems they are prepared, they
            can fight a boss in hopes to unlock better progression, and move on to another area. If the player
            falls to a monster or boss, they will need to restart from the beginning with a new character.
        </p>
        <h3>Genre: rougelike-incremental</h3>
        <h3>Platforms: Web, Mobile Web if time allows.</h3>

        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>Bottle Knights is set in a world where something as useless as a bottle cap can be combined
             to greatly strengthen a hero on their conquest to rid the world from sentient bottles.         
        </p>
        <h2>Aesthetic</h2>
        <p>I am planning to have a cartoon-y style for my entities and background environment (PIXI Window).
            For DOM Elements, I am planning to create a style that fits the aesthetic of traditional bottles, or
            bottle caps (gray plastic, red bottlecap, etc).
        </p>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>With this being partially an incrememntal game, the player will need to manage the intake of
            bottle caps using the DOM elements found on screen. Along with this, the player needs to manage
            the equipment and strength of the main hero. In game game window, the hero fights with the enemies
            by iself indefinitely, and will continue to a boss when the player decides to move on. The scope of this
            project will most likely only include the introductory segments of the game (i.e. the basic enemies and
            first boss), and will include several tooltips and labels to guide the player towards functionality.
